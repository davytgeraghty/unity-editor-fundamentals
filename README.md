# Unity Editor Fundamentals – Learning Project

## Overview

![Gameplay Preview](Screenshots/gameplay.gif)

This repository contains my completed version of the **Unity Learn – Get Started with the Unity Editor** tutorial.

The purpose of this project is to build a strong foundation in **Unity editor workflows, project structure, and core concepts**, and to mark the starting point of my transition into game development. This project is intentionally focused on fundamentals rather than gameplay complexity.

It serves as an early **portfolio milestone**, with future projects expanding into gameplay mechanics, C# scripting, and systems design.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

-   Navigating the Unity Editor (Scene, Game, Hierarchy, Inspector)
-   Working with GameObjects and Components
-   Transform manipulation (position, rotation, scale)
-   Scene setup and organization
-   Prefabs and basic asset workflows
-   Importing and managing assets
-   Lighting, cameras, and editor play mode
-   Unity project structure and best practices for version control

## Project Details

-   **Engine:** Unity
-   **Project Type:** 3D
-   **Language:** C# (minimal — editor-focused project)
-   **Platform:** Desktop (Unity Editor)

## Repository Structure

This repository follows standard Unity version control best practices.

Tracked:

-   `Assets/`
-   `Packages/`
-   `ProjectSettings/`

Ignored:

-   `Library/`
-   `Temp/`
-   `Obj/`
-   `Build/`
-   Other auto-generated Unity and IDE files

This keeps the repository lightweight and easy to clone, while allowing Unity to regenerate required files automatically.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open **Unity Hub**
3. Add the project by selecting the repository folder
4. Use the Unity version specified by the project (or allow Unity Hub to prompt)
5. Open the main scene and press **Play**

## Why This Project Exists

I’m a professional software engineer transitioning into **game development**.  
This project represents my first completed Unity learning milestone and establishes the foundation for more advanced work, including:

-   Gameplay mechanics
-   Player controls and physics
-   C# scripting patterns in Unity
-   Systems-based design
-   Performance and polish

Future repositories will build directly on the concepts learned here.

## Next Steps

-   Build a small playable prototype focused on a single core mechanic
-   Write custom C# scripts for gameplay behaviour
-   Explore physics, input systems, and state management
-   Develop a portfolio-ready vertical slice
